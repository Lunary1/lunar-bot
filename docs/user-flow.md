# üß≠ Pok√©mon SaaS Shopping Bot ‚Äî User Flow

This document outlines the **end-to-end user flow** and **technical architecture** for the Pok√©mon-focused SaaS shopping bot.  
The system is designed to mimic the speed and reliability of StellarAIO, while staying compliant, modular, and scalable.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Users can:

1. **Select Desired Products** ‚Äî from supported Pok√©mon stores (e.g. ToyChamp, Pok√©mon Center EU, Bol.com).
2. **Create Automated Checkout Tasks Seamlessly** ‚Äî configure proxies, accounts, and checkout profiles.
3. **Checkout in Milliseconds** ‚Äî Playwright automates the full checkout process in isolated workers.

Monetization is handled via **subscriptions (Stripe/LemonSqueezy)** or **license key activation**, depending on plan.

---

## ü™Ñ 1. Landing Page (Public)

**Goal:** Convert visitors into paying users or key holders.

**Features:**

- [x] Marketing content (like StellarAIO)
- [x] Product flow: "Select ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Checkout"
- [x] Pricing tiers (Starter, Pro, Lifetime)
- [ ] Blog & SEO for Pok√©mon drop updates

**Tech:**

- [x] Next.js App Router
- [x] Tailwind + Framer Motion
- [ ] Stripe/LemonSqueezy checkout
- [ ] Supabase webhook integration for subscription creation

---

## üîê 2. Authentication & Access Control

**Goal:** Secure user identity and gate access to premium features.

**Flow:**

1. [x] User signs up via Supabase Auth (email/password or OAuth)
2. [ ] Email verification required
3. [x] On login, app checks:
   - [x] Active subscription (Stripe webhook)
   - [ ] OR valid license key (Supabase `license_keys` table)

If neither valid ‚Üí redirect to `/billing`.

**Security:**

- [x] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
- [x] User UUID-based data scoping
- [x] Session management via JWT

**Pitfalls Avoided:**

- [x] No shared session leaks
- [x] All DB calls scoped by user ID
- [ ] Rate limits via middleware (Upstash Redis recommended)

---

## üìä 3. Dashboard Home

**Goal:** Central hub for user operations.

**Tabs:**

- [x] Overview: success rates, latest checkouts
- [x] Tasks: list and manage all active tasks
- [x] Profiles: billing & shipping profiles
- [x] Proxies: personal or team proxy lists
- [x] Accounts: encrypted login credentials
- [x] Billing: plan management
- [x] Logs: recent automation results

**Tech:**

- [x] Next.js + ShadCN UI + React Query
- [x] Supabase for data
- [ ] AES encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Supabase Vault (optional for secret storage)

**Security:**

- [x] Strict RLS by user
- [ ] API throttling to prevent overuse

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Task Creation Wizard

**Goal:** Streamlined creation of checkout tasks.

**Steps:**

1. [x] Select Store
2. [x] Select Product (manual link or product feed)
3. [x] Assign Profile
4. [x] Assign Proxy List
5. [x] Set Delay / Mode / Quantity
6. [x] Confirm & Create

**Tech:**

- [x] ShadCN UI wizard components
- [x] API call creates a new `task` entry in Supabase
- [x] Queue job via Redis (BullMQ)
- [x] Worker picks up and executes with Playwright

**Safety:**

- [x] Playwright workers run isolated from API
- [x] Each task timeout + retry on failure
- [x] Logs stored in `logs` table

---

## üß† 5. Worker Execution (Playwright Backend)

**Goal:** Perform automated checkout efficiently and securely.

**Flow:**

1. [x] Worker continuously polls Redis queue
2. [x] On new job ‚Üí load Playwright browser
3. [x] Use proxy + account + checkout data
4. [x] Attempt purchase
5. [x] Log result in Supabase

**Tech Stack:**

- [x] Node.js + Playwright
- [x] Redis (BullMQ)
- [x] Supabase (results + logging)
- [ ] Docker container for worker isolation

**Pitfalls Avoided:**

- [x] No browser tasks in API routes
- [x] Worker concurrency limits per user
- [x] Retry and error handling built-in

---

## üìú 6. Logs & Analytics

**Goal:** Offer feedback and transparency.

**Flow:**

- [x] Worker writes logs to Supabase `logs` table
- [x] Dashboard subscribes to updates (Realtime API)
- [x] Graphs and success rates via Recharts

**Features:**

- [x] View per-task success/failure
- [x] Export logs (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Retention policy (e.g. 7 days)

---

## üß∞ 7. Admin Dashboard

**Goal:** Give staff visibility and control.

**Features:**

- [x] Search users by email
- [x] Revoke keys / deactivate users
- [ ] Create new stores or task templates
- [x] System metrics overview

**Tech:**

- [x] Protected admin route (`role = admin`)
- [x] Next.js UI
- [x] Supabase role-based access

---

## üí≥ 8. Subscription & Renewal Handling

**Goal:** Automate payments and plan enforcement.

**Subscription Flow:**

- [x] Stripe checkout ‚Üí webhook ‚Üí Supabase `subscriptions` table
- [x] Sync status via webhook listener
- [x] Dashboard shows current plan & renewal date
- [x] On cancel/expire: disable task creation

**License Key Flow:**

- [ ] User enters key ‚Üí backend validates via Supabase
- [ ] Expiration date checked before task creation
- [ ] Keys managed in admin panel

## üí£ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall                          | Preventive Measure               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Auth leaks                       | Supabase RLS + scoped queries    |
| Data exposure                    | AES encrypt stored credentials   |
| Race conditions in webhooks      | Use idempotency keys             |
| Worker overload                  | Implement concurrency limits     |
| Task hangs                       | Timeout + retry + queue logic    |
| API abuse                        | Rate-limit middleware            |
| UI performance issues            | React Query caching + pagination |
