### Current Stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with RLS
- **Queue System**: BullMQ + Redis
- **Workers**: Node.js + Playwright automation
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Multi-step task creation wizard** with validation
2. **Real-time task monitoring** with live updates
3. **Background job processing** with BullMQ
4. **Advanced filtering and search** capabilities
5. **Error handling and retry logic** for reliability
6. **Responsive UI** with modern design patterns

## 🎯 Business Value

This task management system enables:

- **Automated product purchasing** with configurable parameters
- **Real-time monitoring** of task execution
- **Scalable background processing** with queue management
- **Professional user experience** with advanced UI
- **Reliable task execution** with error handling
- **Flexible task configuration** for different use cases

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Worker Deployment**: Run `npm run worker` to start the background worker
2. **Redis Required**: Ensure Redis is running for task queue processing
3. **Bot Integration**: Task execution integrates with existing store bots
4. **Real-time Updates**: Tasks update in real-time via Supabase subscriptions
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and user feedback

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ Real-time task monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Background worker system with BullMQ
- ✅ Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Responsive UI with modern design

**Ready for Milestone 4: Pokémon Product Integration**

## 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Start the main application
npm run dev

# Start the background worker (in separate terminal)
npm run worker

# Start worker in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev:worker
```

## 📝 Environment Setup

Make sure you have Redis running:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Or install Redis locally
# macOS: brew install redis
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install redis-server
```

The task management system is now ready for production use and can handle automated Pokémon product purchasing with full monitoring and control capabilities!
